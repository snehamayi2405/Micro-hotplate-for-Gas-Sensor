# Micro Hotplate for MEMS Gas Sensor â€” COMSOL Simulation

This repository contains COMSOL models and simulation results for designing a micro hotplate used in MEMS-based gas sensors. Two materials were analyzed: **Platinum (Pt)** and **Gold (Au)**.

## ðŸ§ª Project Overview

The micro hotplate is a crucial component of MEMS gas sensors. This study compares Pt and Au as heater materials in terms of:

- Power consumption
- Temperature distribution
- Heat dissipation
- Structural stability

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `COMSOL_Files/`: `.mph` simulation files for Pt and Au versions
- `Images/`: Exported plots showing temperature distribution

## ðŸ“œ Requirements

- COMSOL Multiphysics (version X.X or later)
- (Optional) MATLAB with LiveLink for scripting
